# ranmath
Math library by me, most likely opengl compatible

Code might or might not be stolen from other sources which i may or may have not forgotten the name of...

Aiming to be a single header stb-style library

## How to use
Include ranmath.h in your project:

```#include "ranmath.h"```

## Contribute
Feel free to add functions and similar to the library

Just try to make sure it fits in with the current codebase structure which may or may not be subject of change

## TODO
- Add own definitions of basic functions
- Add vec2, vec3, vec4 stuff
- Add rotate, distance etc...
- Add mat2, mat3, mat4
- Add other stuff
- Optimize
