# ranmath
Math library by me, most likely opengl compatible

Mostly linear algebra stuff

Aiming to be a single header library if i don't get a headache while writing this

***ONLY VEC2 EXISTS RIGHT NOW***

## How to use
Include the header file in your project

## TODO
- Add vec3, vec4
- Add rotate, distance etc...
- Add mat2, mat3, mat4
- Add other stuff
- Optimize
