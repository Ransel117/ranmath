# ranmath
Math library by me.

Aiming to be a single header stb-style library.

## How to use
Include ranmath.h in your project:
```
#include "ranmath.h"
```
or
```
#include <ranmath.h>
```

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute! Try to make sure it fits in with the current codebase which may be subject of change.

## TODO
- add own definitions of basic functions
- mat2 and mat4 SIMD
- add other stuff
- ARM NEON support?
- optimize
