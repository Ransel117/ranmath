# ranmath
Math library by me.

Aiming to be a single header stb-style library.

## How to use
Include ranmath.h in your project:
```
#include "ranmath.h"
```
or
```
#include <ranmath.h>
```

Feel free to make contributions! Try to fit in with the current code base which may change.

## TODO (in no particular order)
- add own definitions of basic functions
- mat2 and mat4 SIMD
